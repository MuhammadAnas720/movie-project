# Trapped.

**Project Description:**

*Do you feel clustered by the voices that are binary? Is the help you get, really helping you? Do you control all that you think you do?
Watch the story of Ishmal who loves to exploit her devices. Not does she know, she is actually Trapped.*


The project is the ultimate immersive experience into our horror short movie, which is the basis of the project. 

The movie we produced for the project was a Horror-suspense movie. The movie was created and produced entirely by the efforts of project team members. The central theme of the movie lies around the horrors of a takeover of our world by technology and the AI. The plot for this central theme makes its way through portrayal of the main characters's absoulte reliance and dependency on technology, particularly AI assistance, and the following concept of being stuck or trapped in it that the character feels.
